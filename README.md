# ChaptarrNG for Unraid

This repository contains ChaptarrNG's standalone Unraid Community Applications
package: its repository profile and Docker template. The application source,
releases, and GHCR images are maintained in
[ChaptarrNG](https://github.com/snapetech/chaptarrng).

ChaptarrNG is Snapetech's maintained Chaptarr fork for ebook and audiobook
libraries. Its SeerrNG-specific changes add format-scoped book requests and
monitoring, durable tracking for imports delayed by author metadata
preparation, and request-safe retry and cancellation. ChaptarrNG remains a
standalone book manager; SeerrNG is optional.

## Submit to Community Applications

Submit this repository URL in the [Unraid Community Apps portal](https://ca.unraid.net/submit):

`https://github.com/snapetech/chaptarrng-unraid`

The template and repository profile are kept here so the portal scans only
Unraid package files, rather than unrelated XML files in the application
source. Run Validate and Scan in the portal before submitting.

## Manual installation

Use the [ChaptarrNG template XML](templates/chaptarrng.xml) with Unraid's
Docker template workflow. It installs `ghcr.io/snapetech/chaptarrng:latest`
and configures persistent appdata, audiobook, ebook, and download paths.

- Web UI: port `8789`
- Appdata: `/mnt/user/appdata/chaptarrng` mapped to `/config`
- Audiobooks: `/mnt/user/media/audiobooks` mapped to `/audiobooks`
- eBooks: `/mnt/user/media/ebooks` mapped to `/ebooks`
- Downloads: `/mnt/user/downloads` mapped to `/downloads`
- Default file ownership: `PUID=99`, `PGID=100`

Set the mapped paths and ownership to match your Unraid shares. For app
configuration and SeerrNG integration, see the
[ChaptarrNG README](https://github.com/snapetech/chaptarrng#readme) and the
[SeerrNG Bookshelf backend guide](https://github.com/snapetech/seerrng/blob/main/docs/using-seerr/bookshelf-backend.md).
